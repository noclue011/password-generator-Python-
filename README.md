## General Information
This is a simple password generator that is made using Python. The password generator asks the user the length of password that they are requesting from the program. The program will then return a randomly generated password of the requested length with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.

I undertook this project as a tutorial to learn the basics of Python.


## Setup
To run this Python project on your local device, run the script locally:

~~~

$ cd ../password-generator-Python-
$ python password-generator.py

~~~


## Technologies Used
* Python 3.10.2
